#+TITLE: better-org-habit.el

The package enhances [[https://www.orgmode.org/][Org mode]] with a gamified habit-tracking system, integrating quests, a virtual store, and a customizable UI. It transforms routine habit tracking into an engaging RPG-like experience, where users earn experience points (XP) and gold for completing tasks and habits, which can be spent on rewards in a virtual store.

Inspired by gamification concepts and habit-tracking apps like [[https://habitica.com/][Habitica]].

* Installation
The package is not yet available on MELPA, but you can install it manually by cloning the repository or downloading the `better-org-habit.el` file. For example, using `use-package` with `straight`:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package better-org-habit
  :straight (better-org-habit :type git :host github :repo "vberezhnev/better-org-habit.el"))
#+end_src

* Usage
Running `M-x hq-habits-quest-view` opens the Org agenda with an appended quest system interface, showing character stats (level, XP, gold), active quests, daily bonuses, and a store button. A sample interface is shown in the screenshot above.

The system includes:
- **Quests**: Multi-day challenges tied to habits (e.g., "Complete morning meditation for 5 days").
- **Store**: A virtual market where users can spend earned gold on rewards like breaks, entertainment, or special privileges.
- **Daily Bonuses**: Randomly assigned daily tasks that grant extra XP and gold.
- **Inventory**: Stores purchased items, which can be used to apply their effects (e.g., "Take a 30-minute break").
- **Habit Streaks**: Tracks consecutive days of habit completion, integrated with Org mode's habit system.

Available keybindings:

| Keybinding      | Command                                     | Description                                                    |
|-----------------+---------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `C-c q`         | `hq-habits-quest-view`                      | Open the agenda with quest system information                  |
| `C-c m`         | `hq-market`                                 | Open the interactive store to buy or use items                 |
| `<f12>`         | `toggle-org-habit-show-all-today`           | Toggle showing all habits or only today's habits in the agenda |
| `q` (in store)  | `quit-window`                               | Close the store buffer                                         |
| `r` (in store)  | `hq-market`                                 | Refresh the store buffer                                       |
| `Z` (in agenda) | `org-habit-stats-view-next-habit-in-agenda` | View stats for the next habit in the agenda                    |

The package integrates with Org mode's agenda and habit system, using `org-habit` for tracking and `org-habit-stats` for statistics. Standard Org mode keybindings (e.g., for agenda navigation) and `magit-section`-like bindings (e.g., `TAB` to toggle sections) are supported.

* Configuration
** Quest System Configuration
The quest system is highly customizable via the `habit-quest-system` customization group (`M-x customize-group RET habit-quest-system`). Key customizable variables include:

- `hq-categories`: Defines task categories with associated colors, base XP, and gold rewards. Example:
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq hq-categories
        '((:name "CORE" :color "#FFD700" :xp 40 :gold 15)
          (:name "ASCENT" :color "#4CAF50" :xp 30 :gold 10)
          (:name "PERSONAL" :color "#6A5ACD" :xp 20 :gold 5)))
  #+end_src

- `hq-quests`: Defines multi-day quests with habits, required days, and rewards. Example:
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq hq-quests
        '((:id 1 :name "Path to Mindfulness"
           :description "Complete all three meditations for 5 consecutive days"
           :habits ("üéØ - Morning Meditation" "üåü - Midday Meditation" "üåø - Evening Meditation")
           :required 5 :progress 0 :completed nil
           :reward-xp 200 :reward-gold 100)))
  #+end_src

- `hq-market-categories`: Defines store categories (e.g., Rest, Entertainment). Example:
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq hq-market-categories
        '((:id "rest" :name "Rest" :icon "üåü" :description "Ways to rest and recover")))
  #+end_src

- `hq-market-items`: Defines store items with costs, categories, and usage messages. Example:
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq hq-market-items
        '((:id "break-30" :name "30-Minute Break" :cost 30 :category "rest"
           :description "A short break to rest"
           :use-message "Relax and recharge!")))
  #+end_src

** Habit Integration
The package extends `org-habit` to display habit streaks and integrates with `org-habit-stats` for detailed statistics. Habits must be defined in Org files with the `:HABIT:` property. Example:
#+begin_src org
* TODO Morning Meditation üéØ
  :PROPERTIES:
  :STYLE: habit
  :END:
#+end_src

The system automatically tracks streaks and updates quest progress based on habit completion.

** Store and Discounts
The store (`M-x hq-market`) supports dynamic discounts that apply randomly for 24 hours. Items can be marked as non-discountable with `:discountable nil`. Example:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(:id "day-off" :name "Day Off" :cost 500 :category "rare"
 :description "A full day off from all tasks"
 :discountable nil
 :use-message "Enjoy your well-deserved day off!")
#+end_src

** Example Configuration
Here‚Äôs an example configuration for a user tracking work and personal habits:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq hq-categories
      '((:name "WORK" :color "#FF4500" :xp 50 :gold 20)
        (:name "PERSONAL" :color "#6A5ACD" :xp 20 :gold 5)))

(setq hq-quests
      '((:id 1 :name "Work Marathon"
         :description "Work 3+ hours daily for 7 days"
         :habits ("‚ö° - 3+ hours of work")
         :required 7 :progress 0 :completed nil
         :reward-xp 500 :reward-gold 250)))

(setq hq-market-items
      '((:id "coffee-break" :name "Coffee Break" :cost 20 :category "rest"
         :description "15-minute coffee break"
         :use-message "Enjoy your coffee!")))
#+end_src

This configuration adds a "WORK" category, a quest for consistent work hours, and a coffee break reward in the store.

** Customizing Habit Display
The package customizes `org-habit` faces to use specific glyphs (e.g., `‚óã`, `‚óè`, `‚óé`) for habit states. These can be adjusted by modifying variables like `org-habit-overdue-glyph`. Note: The current implementation may display glyphs as narrow rectangles with some fonts. A fix is planned (see TODO in the code).

* Ideas and Alternatives
Org mode‚Äôs built-in habit tracking (`org-habit`) provides basic streak tracking but lacks gamification. `better-org-habit` adds a layer of motivation through quests, rewards, and a store, making habit tracking more engaging.

Alternatives include:
- **Habitica**: A standalone app with similar gamification but no Org mode integration.
- **org-habit-stats**: Provides detailed habit statistics but lacks the quest and reward system.
- **Manual Tracking**: Using Org mode‚Äôs agenda and TODO states without gamification, which is less motivating for some users.

This package is ideal for users who want to combine Org mode‚Äôs flexibility with a gamified experience to stay motivated.

* Known Issues
- **Glyph Display**: `org-habit-faces` may appear as narrow rectangles with default Emacs fonts. A future update will address this without requiring a specific font.
- **Dependencies**: Requires `my-org-habit.el` and `org-habit-stats.el`, which must be correctly placed in the specified directories.

* Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Please submit issues or pull requests to [[https://github.com/vberezhnev/better-org-habit.el][the GitHub repository]]. Ideas for new quests, store items, or UI improvements are especially appreciated.
